                helloo! thanks for the gifting me such special things, thankoo
                so much :))
                <br />
                as you know today i am very short of time, haven't had dinner, have
                to go to sleep early too (thank oo for reminiding me though), and
                so we gonna do a song which is fun to listen to and does not need
                too much explanation.
                <br />
                this song is from one of my favorite bangla band, <i
                    >taalpatar shepai</i
                >.
                <br />
                <br />
                well you know the drill, go ahead and listen to the song first, i
                will be waiting...
                <br />
                <br />
                this song is all about self discovery and how puzzling that journey
                can be. here we are wondering about streets, hoppoing from roof to
                roof, going through all the pages from our old books trying to find
                ourself.
                <br />
                <br />
                but end of the day we can't help ourself from appreciating you and
                your beauty despite it being <i>our</i> journey of self discovery.
                <br />
                <br />
                <i>lagche boro tomake bhalo</i>
                <br />
                <i>sab rongin naki monta rangalo</i>
                <br />
                <i>surjer saathe roj jalo alo</i>
                <br />
                <i>ghuche jak jyoto aandhar kalo</i>
                <br />
                <br />
                "your arrival has painted my entire heart, you have radiated away
                all the darkness, and you look fanstastic."
                <br />
                "you are so beautiful and gorgeous that if you ask for it everything
                is possible, everyone is slave to your beauty, even the most famous
                poets will sweat from head to toe in your command."
                <br />
                <br />
                <i>ei ganta ki tomay bhavabe?</i>
                <br />
                <i>shudhu hasi naki chokh rangabe</i>
                <br />
                <i>aami boli jodi paro</i>
                <br />
                <i>tumio khonjo tomay</i>
                <br />
                <br />
                "i am already in my journey, hope this song makes you ponder too,
                so my advice: go discover yourself as well."
                <br />
